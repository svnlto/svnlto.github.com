<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have been working as a server administrator for several years and I have
really enjoyed doing this. But I find myself becoming increasingly interested in
web design and web technology. Having started on the server-end I have slowly
moved away to front-end related things as I started working for <a href="http://e-noise.com/">E-NOISE</a>. During
the time at <a href="http://e-noise.com/">E-NOISE</a> I had the opportunity to do a lot of research on topics
such as HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>After having worked around web technology for a few years I am at a stage in
my career where I would like to expand my experience by joining a larger team.
In this scenario I am looking for a competitive, engaging, and fast-paced position
as a front-end developer and/or designer in the web based industry to become an
expert front-end engineer.</p>
