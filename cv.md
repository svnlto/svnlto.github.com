## Introduction ##

I have been working in server administration related jobs for many years and
really enjoyed doing this but I found myself becoming more and more interested in
web design and web technology moving away from server administration based work to
more front-end related things as I started working in the web industry.

## Objective ##

For the past few years I have been working around web technology with [E-NOISE](http://e-noise.com/)
and I have had a great time but I am at a stage in my career where i would
like to expand my experience by joining a larger team. In this scenario I'm
looking for a competitive, engaging, and fast-paced position as a front-end developer
and/or designer in the web based industry.
